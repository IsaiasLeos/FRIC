> The purpose of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to give the customer a clear and precise
description of the functionality of the Findings and Reporting Information Console (FRIC) System. The SRS
divides the system requirements into two parts, behavioral and non-behavioral requirements. The behavioral
requirements describe the interaction between the system and its environment. Non-behavioral requirements
relate to the definition of the attributes of the product as it performs its functions. This includes performance
requirements of the product.
